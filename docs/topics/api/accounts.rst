-------

.. _`profile`:

.. note:: This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`.

This endpoint is a shortcut to your own account. It returns an :ref:`account object <account-object-self>`

.. http:get:: /api/v3/accounts/profile/

    .. _self-account-object:

.. note:: This API requires :doc:`authentication <auth>`.


This allows you to generate a new user account and sign in as that user.

.. important::

    * Your API user must be in the ``Accounts:SuperCreate`` group to access
      this endpoint. Use ``manage.py createsuperuser --add-to-supercreate-group``
      to create a superuser with proper access.
    * This endpoint is not available in all
      :ref:`API environments <api-environments>`.

.. http:post:: /api/v3/accounts/super-create/

    **Request:**

    :param email: assign the user a specific email address.
        A fake email will be assigned by default.
    :param username: assign the user a specific username.
        A random username will be assigned by default.
    :param fxa_id:
        assign the user a Firefox Accounts ID, like one
        returned in the ``uuid`` parameter of a
        `profile request <https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-profile-server/blob/master/docs/API.md#get-v1profile>`_.
        This is empty by default, meaning the user's account will
        need to be migrated to a Firefox Account.
