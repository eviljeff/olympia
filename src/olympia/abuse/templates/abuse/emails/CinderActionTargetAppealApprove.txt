Hello,

Previously, your {{ type }} was suspended/removed from Mozilla Add-ons, based on a finding that you had violated Mozilla's add-on policies. We have conducted further investigation{% if not is_override %} in response to your appeal{% endif %}, and determined that the previous decision was inaccurate. Based on that determination, we have restored your {{ type }}, and is now available at {{ target_url }}.

Thank you.
