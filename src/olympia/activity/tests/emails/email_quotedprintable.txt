Hello,


Your add-on, Addon 1.0.3, has been reviewed and did not meet the
criteria for being hosted in our gallery.

Reviewer:
Andreas Wagner

Comments:
This version didn't pass review because of the following problems:

1) A custom CSP for adding Google Analytics is not necessary. Please use
the recommended method described in
https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/05/31/using-google-analytics-in-extens=
ions/
Related to that, the remote script injection in popup.html#L14 and
popup.js#L32 is strictly prohibited.

2) Your add-on includes a JavaScript library file that doesn't match any
versions known to us. We require all add-ons to use unmodified release
versions.
* jQuery
